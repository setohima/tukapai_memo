Kawaii is justice 

Hi there. I’m Masashi Otsuka 

Happy Hacker is my job:)

My work is to design people's happiness through programming.

I like Linux, not ◯indows.

My　skill is
Python, OpenStack, Java, ShellScript, and more

Let's join forces and do our best.

My wake up everyday do

```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hi What time is now?"
date "%H%M%S"
echo "It's Okey, so what should I do?"
./check_daily_commit.sh
echo "Got it, anything else?"
python check_my_work.py

```

like python code something
```
# check_my_work.py
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import human langage
import my passion
import brisk

def checkMyWork():
    try:
        mymind.open(If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?)
        print("Of course, If you say you'll do it tomorrow, you will be an idiot.")

    except mymind.Error as E:
        print("It is time to change something...")


checkMyWork()
```
